Hey everyone, welcome to our github page. We are pupils from Immaculata Instituut, Belgium and
this is going to be our website. We are a team of 6 members and this is the first time we work
together. The purpose of our website? It's an introduction-site for people who visit our school.
It's not done yet and we're working on it with everyone. Thank you for reading and i hope you
won't notice we are amateurs ;).
